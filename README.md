# Balanced Binary Search Tree

## Data Structures Project 2 

This program provides balanced rendering of numbers entered in Binary Search Tree.

In this project, you will construct a BST with the keys that are in the given input file. The BST has the following properties:
⦁	its nodes are distributed over 3log4 n depth levels;
⦁	it provides the best possible total access time.

Example input:
<br>
⦁	10 5 3 25 70 97 115 2 65 69 32 152 1 21 49 8 12 78
