# Balanced Binary Search Tree

## Data Structures Project 2 

This program provides balanced rendering of numbers entered in Binary Search Tree.

In this project, you will construct a BST with the keys that are in the given input file. The BST has the following properties:
<br>
⦁	its nodes are distributed over 3log4 n depth levels;
<br>
⦁	it provides the best possible total access time.

Example input:
<br>
⦁	10 5 3 25 70 97 115 2 65 69 32 152 1 21 49 8 12 78

Output:
<br>
Depth level of BST is 6
<br>
Depth level 0 1
<br>
Depth level 1 2
<br>
Depth level 2 4
<br>
Depth level 3 8
<br>
Depth level 4 2
<br>
Depth level 5 1
<br>
Key value to be searched (Enter 0 to exit) : 32
<br>
At Depth level 3, 4th element
<br>
Key value to be searched (Enter 0 to exit) : 152
<br>
At Depth level 3, 8th element
<br>
Key value to be searched (Enter 0 to exit) : 78
<br>
At Depth level 1, 2nd element
<br>
Key value to be searched (Enter 0 to exit) : 4
<br>
4 is not found in BST
<br>
Key value to be searched (Enter 0 to exit) : 0
<br>
Exit
